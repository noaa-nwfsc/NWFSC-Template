# Instructions for repositories within the noaa-nwfsc organization

1) Update your `README.md` file to include the disclaimer and an open access license (if repo is public). These are below.
2) Add a description and info on who created the content (otherwise the org managers will not know who to contact).
3) Add tags (far right side on repo) to help users find repositories. See the other repositories for examples.
4) Add the LICENSE file and edit for your content. Note LICENSE files are important for repositories that are public and that are "products" in some way. For example, data, code package, documentation, etc.
5) Add the file `.github/workflows/secretSCAN.yml`. This will check for token and keys that are accidentally committed to a repository.

## Collaborators

If you have collaborators on your repository who are not members of the NMFS GitHub Enterprise Cloud account, you will need to contact an administrator to help you add them to your repository or to transfer in your repository with outside collaborators.
